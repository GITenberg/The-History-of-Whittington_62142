<i>History of Whittington</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> local descriptions and
circumstances are seldom productive of any high degree of
interest, yet when they become connected with the adventurous,
active, and surprising career of any remarkable individual, even
the most trivial assumes a degree of importance, excites a lively
curiosity, and seldom tails to gratify the expectation it has
awakened.&nbsp; As the ruins of the castle at this place are in
an eminent degree picturesque and beautiful, and its being the
birthplace and residence of one of the Barons to whom we owe the
blessing of the <span class="smcap">Magna Charta</span>, as well
as the scene of many of his surprising adventures; even the short
account I propose to offer, cannot be wholly devoid of
entertainment and instruction.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>It is the
opinion of learned antiquarians, that this was the place so famed
by the name of Drev-Wen, or the White Town, by the illustrious
Welsh poet Lowarch Hen, who lived in the year 590.&nbsp; He says
that a prince of his country named Cynddylan was defeated and
fell here, in opposing the progress of the Irish who had invaded
the country.&nbsp; This ancient bard expresses the rage of the
battle in such an energetic manner, that if I attempt to describe
it, I shall fall far short of the original; therefore I content
myself with quoting his own words.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>A.D. 843.</h3>
<p>In the time of Roderick the Great, king of all Wales, Ynyr ap
Cadfarch, a British nobleman, built the Castle of Whittington; to
which he was succeeded by his son Tudor Trevor, who altho&rsquo;
possessed of many palaces, with rich and extensive <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>domains, made
this his chief residence.&nbsp; By right of his father he
obtained the lordships of both Maelors, Whittington, Chirk,
Oswestry, Ewais, and Urchenfield; and by right of his mother
Rhiengar, the earldom of Hereford.&nbsp; His mother was
grand-daughter to Caradoc Freichfas, who fell in the field of
battle at Rhuddlan, A.D. 795, gloriously maintaining the cause of
the Britons against their Pagan invaders, the Saxons.</p>
<p>The descendants of Tudor continued possessed of the Castle for
several generations; and many families both in this neighbourhood
and North Wales, boast their origin from him.</p>
<h3>A.D. 1060.</h3>
<p>At the Conquest, Whittington became the property of Pain
Peverel, who having no issue, on his decease it was seized by
Roger earl of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; This place was called in Doomsday
Book, Wititone; and consisted at that time of eight corn farms,
twelve ox-stalls, and a very extensive wood; the cows yielded
five shillings per annum, and all Welsh residents were obliged to
pay twenty shillings rent among them.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>The
castle and lordship of Whittington next passed into the hands of
Hugh, and afterwards of his brother Robert, sons of the late earl
of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Upon the defeat and forfeiture of Robert by
Henry I. it was restored to the Peverels in the person of Sir
William, a sister&rsquo;s son of Pain Peverel.&mdash;This Sir
William is famed in history for his noble and valiant
enterprizes, in one of which it is stated that he was mortally
wounded, but was miraculously recovered by eating the shield of a
wild boar; and that to testify his gratitude to Heaven for his
preservation he built three churches.</p>
<h3>A.D. 1083.</h3>
<p>He had two daughters, the youngest of which was named Mellet:
she with the spirit of an Amazon, resolved to wed no one but the
knight of most consummate valour.&nbsp; Her father published this
declaration, and promised the Castle of Whittington as her
dower.&nbsp; Several distinguished combatants assembled at
Peverel&rsquo;s place in the Peak, Derbyshire, to contend for the
fair prize; and among whom were, a son of the king of Scotland,
Baron Burgoyne, and a noble Lorrainer, Guarine De Metz, (sheriff
of Shropshire, and chief counsellor to the earl of Shrewsbury;)
the latter of whom came with a shield of silver, and <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>a proud peacock
upon his crest; and having overthrown his rivals, obtained the
beautiful Mellet.</p>
<p>As chivalry was the greatest accomplishment in these times,
the progeny of this famed couple could hardly avoid being
eminently distinguished by feats of arms, and the consequence
was, that their names occupied very great portions in romances
both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>I must not forget to state, that Guarine De Metz was a great
benefactor to the Monks: one remarkable instance of which is
this; after a conflict he had with the Welsh, led by their prince
Jorwerth, (in which action the latter was discomfited with all
his host) our hero founded the New Abbey, better known by the
name of Alberbury.</p>
<p>The posterity of this great man for nine generations assumed
the Christian name of Fulk; they continued possessed of the
castle from the end of the reign of Henry I. till the time of
Henry VIII. a period of near four hundred years.&nbsp; Their
common name was Fitz-Gwarine.&nbsp; Mr. Dovaston in his poem,
thus expresses himself on this subject:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Sires were his from days of yore,<br />
Who all the same distinction bore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of title and of name;<br />
A name that valour&rsquo;s blazon&rsquo;d blade<br />
In feats of chivalry had made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The favourite of fame.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guarine De Metz died in the reign of Henry I. at Alberbury,
where he was interred; his wife and his son Fulk Fitz-Gwarine
being present on the occasion.</p>
<p>We have mentioned that Guarine De Metz first exerted his
valour in the cause of love, and that great commendation was
bestowed on him in consequence; this was exactly the case with
his son; he became desperately enamoured with Hawys, daughter of
Sir Joos, of Normandy, who had been appointed guardian of the
hero in question.&nbsp; Fitz-Gwarine observing Hawys to be
frequently in great sorrow, desired to know the cause of it, and
was informed that it proceeded from the dangerous situation of
her father, being at that time in the hands of Walter Lacy and
Sir Arnold de Lis, two of his inveterate enemies.&nbsp; Upon
hearing this, Fulk resolved to rescue him, and being supplicated
by her whom he adored, he set off immediately and arrived in time
just to <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>save
the head of Joos from the fatal stroke that would instantly have
severed it from the body.&nbsp; The consequences were, Lacy and
Arnold were taken prisoners and confined in Ludlow castle; Joos
was snatched from the most perilous situation to a most happy
one; and to crown all, Fulk and Hawys were joined together, and
harmony again reigned in both families.</p>
<h3>A.D. 1122.</h3>
<p>Fulk Fitz-Gwarine acted the hero in all his enterprizes with
such vigour, capacity, and celerity, that Henry I. knighted him,
made him steward of his house, and conferred on him the arduous
office of Lieutenant of the Marches; it was this that gave him
the name of Fulco or Fulk, signifying Lieutenant.&nbsp; In this
department his sword did not long remain undrawn; the Cambrian
Prince, Gryffydd ap Cynan, according to the general practice of
his countrymen, made a descent upon the lordship of Whittington,
and the surrounding country.&nbsp; These incursions were made so
frequently, and attended with such pernicious effects, that the
power of the Lords&rsquo; Marchers was often necessary to repel
their progress: indeed this was their sole office, and a very
useful one it was.&nbsp; In the present case, Fitz-Gwarine nobly
conducted <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>himself, by wounding the Welsh king in the shoulder, and
completely routing his army.&nbsp; The Welsh however returned
soon after, drove Fulk from the Castle of Whittington, and gained
possession of the lordship; and it appears from a peace made by
Henry II. with Owen Gwynedd, the succeeding prince of Wales, that
it was kept by the latter, and bestowed on one of his favourites,
of the name of Roger; Fulk had the manor of Alston, in
Gloucestershire as a recompence.</p>
<p>It is recorded that Fulk Fitz-Gwarine, and John son to Henry
II. afterwards King John, were playing at chess together, when it
happened that they disagreed, and the prince gave Fulk a severe
blow upon the head with the board, which the latter returned in
such a violent manner, as almost to kill the young prince; a
circumstance, had it happened, not much to be regretted, were it
not in consideration of the glorious Magna Charta afterwards
obtained from him.</p>
<p>Mr. Dovaston in speaking of the noble actions of Fitz-Gwarine,
mentions Fulk and John&rsquo;s quarrel in the following
manner:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;Enough to name our last affray,<br />
The prince his temper lost at play,<br />
The chess-board swung with coward sway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hurl&rsquo;d my head upon.<br
/>
Ill could the wrong my bosom brook,<br />
I sent him first a furious look,<br />
Then firm with knuckles clench&rsquo;d I strook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pate of royal John.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fulk Fitz-Gwarine was succeeded by his eldest son, who bore
the same name.&nbsp; He raised the glory and dignity of his
family beyond any thing it had yet attained to, by numerous and
valourous actions, hereafter respectively to be recorded.&nbsp;
At the time, his father died, he was actively engaged in
Lombardy, where he conducted himself with such ability and
vigour, that king</p>
<h3>A.D. 1189.</h3>
<p>Richard I. just before he went on the Crusades, made him Lord
Marcher of Wales, an office that required all the exertion and
capacity that could possibly exist in one man.</p>
<p>In the beginning of king John&rsquo;s reign, Whittington was
in the hands of Maurice, brother to the person to whom Owen
Gwynedd presented it.&nbsp; Fulk Fitz-Gwarine made application to
John for this place, the ancient property and residence of his <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>family; but
Maurice by means of his opulence and well-timed presents had
sufficient influence over the king, to retain the possessions he
so much desired: nevertheless, Fitz-Gwarine had a steady and
judicious friend in one John of Raumpayne, a minstrel, whom he
made his trusty spy over the conduct of Maurice at
Whittington.&nbsp; In those times when men considered the sword a
better instrument of revenge or defence, than the laws of their
country, and when one Baron insulted another, a petty war ensued
between them, often attended with much bloodshed, and generally
concluded with the demolition, or at least capture of the castle
of one party by the other.&nbsp; It was the failing of our hero
to have recourse to this method of gaining possession, to what he
thought himself fairly entitled; any other means would have been
considered in a very dishonourable light by those turbulent
barons and knights, who were his friends.&nbsp; I hope that this
action, or to express it in the language of that age, this
<i>feat</i> of arms of Fulk, will not dispossess the reader of
that kindness he has shown to Fitz-Gwarine and his historian, by
favouring him so far with an attentive and indulgent
perusal.&nbsp; All I can say of the battle made by Fulk upon
Maurice is, that the <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>latter was slain, and the king of
Wales gave Fulk the Castle of Whittington, by which it appears,
that prince espoused his cause.&nbsp; But the English king made
Wrenoc (son to Maurice) Lord of Whittington, and sent privily to
the prince of Wales to behead Fulk, who avoided the policy of
king John by flying into France, with the assumed name of Sir
Amice, a wandering knight.&nbsp; He was so admired by the French
King for his honourable and chivalrous conduct, that he offered
him a barony of France, which Fulk politely declined.&mdash;By
some means it happened that Lewis, the French king, discovered
Fitz-Gwarine; upon which, the latter fled into Brittainy, where
his deeds of chivalry were so applauded, that a celebrated French
author collected and published them, forming a work universally
read by the chevaliers and ladies of that age.&nbsp; The title
given to the English translation is, &ldquo;The Feates of Gwarine
and his Sunnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fitz-Gwarine formed a resolution of leaving France, and
returning to his own country: he accordingly embarked, and landed
at Dover, with a full determination to see king John.&nbsp; For
fear of discovery, Fulk exchanged clothes with a peasant: <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>in this
habit, attended by his brethren and other followers who had gone
with him to France, and followed his fortunes home again, he
repaired to Windsor forest, where he found the king hunting, and
what was more advantageous to Fulk&rsquo;s purpose, John happened
to be alone.&nbsp; He asked Fulk whether he saw or could find any
game? who answered, that if he would come with him, he should
have game in abundance.&nbsp; John was led to Fulk&rsquo;s
brethren, and Fulk having the king in his power, menaced him
severely for the treatment he (Fitz-Gwarine) had received from
him; and obliged the captive king to grant to him the Castle of
Whittington, which that monarch readily agreed to, for willingly
would he sacrifice almost any thing to gain his liberty; several
instances of which may be seen in English history.</p>
<p>The poem of Fitz-Gwarine, thus describes the subject last
treated of.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For woodman&rsquo;s garb I chang&rsquo;d my
cloak,<br />
In Windsor&rsquo;s wood of ancient oak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We found a safe retreat;<br />
The king I knew there chas&rsquo;d the deer,<br />
And with my faithful comrades there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I conn&rsquo;d a cunning feat.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;One day the King alone appear&rsquo;d,<br />
When scarce the distant horn was heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our hiding place hard by;<br />
And as across my way he came,<br />
Know&rsquo;st thou (quoth he) of any game?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Aye&mdash;game enough, (quoth I).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride to yon briery dingle rough<br />
Trust me, I&rsquo;ll rouse ye game enough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My bugle then I sounded,<br />
My comrades heard the blast I blew,<br />
Obey&rsquo;d the signal that they knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon the King surrounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cow&rsquo;d was the King with speechless fear,<br />
Yet stammer&rsquo;d out, Who have we here?<br />
I flung my bonnet from my brow,<br />
Know&rsquo;st thou (quoth I) Fitz-Gwarine now?<br />
I took a sword and o&rsquo;er him swung it,<br />
Then at his feet contemptuous flung it,<br />
And turning to my comrade class,<br />
Open, (I cried,) and let him pass.<br />
Now go, Sir King, in freedom go,<br />
And copy courage from a foe.<br />
I&rsquo;ll grant (he cried,) a pardon free,<br />
Fitz-Gwarine unto thine and thee,<br />
And I&rsquo;ll restore to thee anon<br />
The franchise fair of Whittington.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>John,
however, disregarded his promise, for as soon as he got home, he
sent fifteen knights after Fulk, either to capture or kill
him.&nbsp; Fulk acted his part with such valour, that the knights
were entirely discomfited, and their leader taken prisoner.&nbsp;
Soon after this, John sent Randolph, earl of Chester, with a
numerous retinue to take Fulk, but the latter fled to sea, on
board a ship belonging to Madour of the Mount, a true friend of
Fitz-Gwarines&rsquo;: while lying in channel, Fulk observed a
knight in disguise coming to kill him; but the courage of our
hero did not forsake him on this occasion, for in the laudable
act of self defence, he slew the concealed assassin, and sailed
to Orkney.&nbsp; Here he released a damsel from captivity; and by
some noble exploit, won his celebrated hauberk of hard steel,
which with other ancient pieces of armour belonging to his
family, hung till Cromwell&rsquo;s time in the church of
Whittington.</p>
<p>The stay of Fitz-Gwarine at Orkney was short, for we soon
after find him driven by tempests to the coast of Barbary.&nbsp;
In contemplation upon this dreary part of the globe, he formed a
resolution of seeing Carthage, the city that produced such
invincible heroes, whose courage defended <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>that small
republic for a considerable time, against the powerful arms of
the Roman empire.&nbsp; But when he saw this once opulent and
populous city crumbled nearly to dust, he felt strong emotions of
pity mixed with veneration.&nbsp; Here! he exclaimed, was born
and educated, Hanibal the greatest general in ancient history,
who made the Romans tremble at their own capital!&nbsp; In these
streets, what patriotism prevailed among all classes of
people!&nbsp; Here commerce flourished; and great improvement was
made in its concomitant navigation.&nbsp; Wrapt in enthusiasm,
Fitz-Gwarine set sail for England, full of hearty desires that
his own country might one day thrive by trade in as conspicuous a
manner as Carthage had done.&nbsp; Upon his arrival, he had the
good fortune to obtain a pardon for himself and followers,
together with the restoration of Whittington castle, and all its
appendages.&nbsp; I have mentioned that John gave this place to
Wrenoc, but he held it for the service of being interpreter
between the Welsh and English; and when the king gave Whittington
to Fulk, Wrenoc had certain estates in the neighbourhood, given
him in compensation.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>The
splendour Fitz-Gwarine lived in, is described by Mr. Dovaston in
such a striking manner, that I cannot refrain from quoting the
words he uses to such advantage.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Other guests than yon lone bird,<br />
And other musick here was heard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In times of better days;<br />
Festive revelry went round,<br />
The board with blushing goblets crown&rsquo;d,<br />
And costly carpets clad the ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where now yon cattle graze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Days were those of splendor high,<br />
Days of hospitality,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When to his rich domain<br />
Welcom&rsquo;d many a crested knight,<br />
Welcom&rsquo;d many a lady bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fitz-Gwarine of Lorraine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>A.D. 1207.</h3>
<p>The next laudable action of Fitz-Gwarine, of which we have any
authentic account is, his going on an expedition into Ireland, in
the service of the English king.&nbsp; He behaved with such
intrepidity and loyalty, that after his return to England, he
received the title of <span class="smcap">The Great</span>: an
appellation more frequently conferred on the destroyers of the
human race, than on those who contribute to the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>real welfare
of mankind, by the discoveries in the arts and sciences. <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<h3>A.D. 1215.</h3>
<p>Upon the dissatisfaction and rebellion of the Barons against
king John, Fulk joined with them; for we find his name among the
number that were excommunicated by the Pope, for extorting from
John that firm basis of English liberty, called <span
class="smcap">Magna Charta</span>.</p>
<h3>A.D. 1219.</h3>
<p>In the succeeding reign, viz. that of Henry III., Fitz-Gwarine
procured a grant of his estates, to him and his heirs for ever;
for which he gave the king two coursers, and two hundred and
sixty-two pounds, an enormous sum in that age, and which gives us
an idea of the wealth of Fitz-Gwarine.&nbsp; The same monarch
also granted him the liberty of a fair on St. Luke&rsquo;s day,
and a market on Wednesday, at Whittington; but on account of its
proximity to Oswestry and Ellesmere, both market and fair are now
quite lost.&nbsp; There were, however, fairs on the last
Thursdays in April, July, and <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>November, in the memory of several of
the present inhabitants; but in want of sufficient attendance,
they were discontinued.&nbsp; They consisted chiefly of horses,
oxen, sheep and swine, that were, in a great measure, furnished
from the extensive common of Babin&rsquo;s wood: upon the
inclosure of which, great part of the land that before had reared
cattle, sheep, &amp;c. was converted to arable purposes, and
consequently the fairs were but ill supplied with those useful
animals, which defect was the principal cause of the putting a
stop to the fairs.</p>
<p>Strange, lord of Knockin, and possessor of the castle there,
had several conflicts or wars with Fitz-Gwarine, during the
agitated reign of John.&nbsp; In some of these skirmishes they
threw down, or considerably damaged each others castle; for we
find grants given by Henry III. to each of these Barons to repair
and fortify them.&nbsp; Whittington castle was so completely
fortified by Fitz-Gwarine, that we never after hear of its being
taken from its possessors.&nbsp; Out of the refuse materials
Fitz-Gwarine built a chapel that soon became the parish church,
and of which, I shall say more hereafter.</p>
<p>In a tower in the gateway was till very <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>lately a
figure on horseback, representing Fitz-Gwarine painted in a
course manner, under which were the following lines, alluding to
his fortifying the castle:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This was Sir Foulke Fitz-Warine late a
great and valiant knight,<br />
Who kept the Britons still in awe and oft times put to flight;<br
/>
He of this castle owner was, and kept it by command,<br />
Of Henry late surnam&rsquo;d the Third, then king of all this
land.</p>
<p>His grandfather, a Lorrainer, by fame was much befriended,<br
/>
Who Peverley&rsquo;s daughter took to wife, from whom this Fulk
descended;<br />
His ancient acts of chivalry in annals are recorded,<br />
Our king of England afterwards him baron made and
lorded.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fulk Fitz-Gwarine had the misfortune to be stricken with
blindness in his old age.&nbsp; Upon his death, he was buried in
the porch of Whittington church; and his remains were found there
in an oak coffin three inches thick, by digging a grave in the
year, 1796.</p>
<p>He had a daughter named Eva, who was second wife to Llewelyn,
king of Wales; and it was through her that Fitz-Gwarine came to
know of John&rsquo;s private message to <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Llewelyn,
which I omitted to mention in its right place.</p>
<p>I state from very good authority, that this Fulk, or to avoid
confusion Fulk the second, was married to Clarice of Abbourville,
but of what family she was, or when they were married, I have not
been able to discover.&nbsp; Fitz-Gwarine, it is stated, went
generally by the appellation of Proudhome, as a mark of respect
to his nobility.</p>
<p>He left behind him a son, who enjoyed his father&rsquo;s
estates and titles, but for no considerable time.&nbsp; He
followed king Henry III. through all that prince&rsquo;s adverse
fortune, and righting in his behalf at the battle of Lewes, had
the irreparable misfortune of being drowned in the act of
crossing a river; leaving behind him a young son, the fourth
Fitz-Gwarine.</p>
<p>Dugdale states, that it was Fitz-Gwarine the second who was
drowned at Lewes; but though, a most excellent historian, he is
certainly wrong in this particular, for the following reasons:
When Fitz-Gwarine the second was appointed Lieutenant of the
Marches in the first year of Richard I. he at least must have
been of age; and from <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>that time to the battle of Lewes was
75 years, consequently he must have been near 100 years old; an
age, at which it is highly improbable he could have been found in
the field of battle.&nbsp; Besides, we are informed, that the
Fulk who fell at Lewes, left a son in his minority, which is very
unlikely to have been the case with Fulk the second at such an
advanced age.&nbsp; Another, though not so strong as the two
preceding proofs, is the certainty of Fitz-Gwarine the second
being buried at Whittington; a circumstance that could hardly
have taken place, if Dugdale&rsquo;s statement had been
correct.&nbsp; Though this might have happened, yet the other two
are sufficient arguments to prove that the son is the person whom
that author has mistaken for the father.</p>
<p>Immediately after the battle, (the events of which must be
known to every person who has read the English history) the earl
of Leicester created Peter de Montford, one of his chief
accomplices, governor of Whittington castle.&nbsp; Leicester also
obliged the captive king to deliver Whittington with several
other bordering castles, into the hands of Llewelyn ap Gryffydd,
king of Wales, by a writ dated from Hereford, June 22,
1265.&nbsp; That cruel earl likewise, in Henry&rsquo;s name, <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>gave Llewelyn
the entire sovereignity of Wales, and homage of all the barons
under him.&nbsp; Henry, after he regained his liberty, confirmed
those grants, but for what reason I have not been able to make
apparent, unless money was his object, as it was done in
consideration of Llewelyn giving him 30,000 marks as a
recompense.</p>
<h3>A.D. 1281.</h3>
<p>Fulk the fourth having arrived at years of maturity, made
proof of his age to Edward I. who invested him with all his
patrimonial estates except Whittington, which he also obtained
upon his accompanying the English monarch on his expedition
against the Welsh.&nbsp; He behaved with such intrepid bravery,
that Edward, in reward for his meritorious conduct, allowed him
the liberty of a <i>Free Warren</i> on his lands in this manor,
and likewise forgave him two hundred pounds that Fulk owed to the
exchequer.</p>
<h3>A.D. 1300.</h3>
<p>This year the king used his influence in reconciling
Fitz-Gwarine and Richard, earl of Arundel, in consequence of a
quarrel prevailing at that time between these two powerful and
predominant barons; but the breach was amicably adjusted by the
interposition of Edward&rsquo;s good offices.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>Fitz-Gwarine died in the reign of Edward leaving a son,
at that time engaged in the war prosecuted by that king against
France: his lady Eleanor, had permission to use livery for this
manor, until her husband could return to do homage.&nbsp; He
performed very considerable services for the king in sundry
campaigns, particularly in Flanders and Scotland, where, by his
gallant conduct, he made himself as much renowned as any of his
predecessors.</p>
<h3>A.D. 1329.</h3>
<p>Edmund earl of Kent, uncle to the king, being suspected of
circulating reports, that Edward II. was then alive, he accused
Fitz-Gwarine of promising him aid, in case Kent could bring about
a rebellion, for which our hero was deprived of the castle of
Whittington; but some of his friends, who had influence with
Edward obtained it back for him in the following year, the king
being perfectly convinced of his loyalty.</p>
<h3>A.D. 1350.</h3>
<p>In this year, or the twenty-third of Edward III., Fitz-Gwarine
the fifth departed this life; and was succeeded by his son, Fulk
the sixth; who, four years before had the honour of signalizing
himself at the memorable battle of Cressy, the first <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>great action
that convinced the French of that undaunted courage which
existed, and still continues to exist, amongst the inhabitants of
this fair isle.&nbsp; Fitz-Gwarine, likewise, accompanied the
Black Prince into Gascoigne, when that young prince carried his
successful arms into that quarter of France;</p>
<h3>A.D. 1356.</h3>
<p>and was at the illustrious battle of Poictiers, where the
whole army gained universal applause:&mdash;headed by a general,
whose noble and generous conduct shone with meridian splendour,
not only in this, but in every other campaign he was engaged in;
and whose whole life was one continued scene of invincible
courage, adorned with all that clemency and nobleness of soul, so
much to be admired in a prince.</p>
<h3>A.D. 1374.</h3>
<p>Fitz-Gwarine, for the important services he rendered to his
country, was, upon his return there, created <span
class="smcap">Baron Marcher</span> of Wales; this is the last
well-grounded anecdote that we have of him, except the date of
his death, which took place in the forty-seventh of Edward
III.</p>
<p>The next Fulk was only seven years old at the death of his
father.&nbsp; He became possessed of a greater extent of property
than <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>any
of his ancestors, but did not long enjoy it: he was cut off at
the early age of twenty-five; and by will, ordered that his body
should be interred in the chancel of Whittington church.&nbsp;
The greatest part of his possessions lay in other counties, but
he considered Whittington the most eligible place for his
sepulture, as it had been the general residence of his family for
several generations.&nbsp; It appears that he also left a minor
son, for his will appoints J. Audley, guardian over the young
prince.</p>
<p>The only account we have of this Fulk, is the following humane
action: when Owen Glyndwr carried his arms into these borders, on
purpose to meet Percy, earl of Northumberland at Shrewsbury,
several in this manor joined with that potent rebel; but
Fitz-Gwarine, by solicitations to Henry IV. procured for them a
general pardon.&nbsp; His son and successor was the ninth and
last Fulk Fitz-Gwarine: he died in his minority, and the male
line of this noble and distinguished race, closes; though the
title of Fitz-Gwarine, or Fitz-Warine was assumed for a few
generations afterwards.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, only sister and heiress to Fulk <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>the 9th, was
married to one Richard Haukford, who dying, left all his
possessions to his only daughter Thomasine, who married sir
William Bourchier, brother to Henry, first earl of Essex.&nbsp;
The title of lord Fitz-Warine was given to sir William in
consequence of his marriage.&nbsp; John, third in descent from
him, exchanged Whittington with Henry VIII. for other landed
property.&nbsp; This John was the first earl of Bath, and his
posterity preserved the title of Fitz-Warine till the race became
extinct, which took place at the death of Henry, fifth earl of
Bath.</p>
<p>And here it may not be improper to take a general view of this
illustrious and warlike race, that flourished through such a
number of reigns, and retained their estates, titles, honours,
acquisitions, and privileges, until nearly their final
termination of the race.&mdash;In whatever light war is
considered in the present day, no period of history ever
discountenanced it; to be skilled in arms has been always
considered the highest and most honourable acquisition, that an
individual could attain to, in all ages and amongst all nations,
though it must be confessed this is chiefly to be accounted for
from the slow <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>progress of civilization, as the encouragement of war
must necessarily decrease in proportion to the extension of
humanity; and it must be allowed by all, that amidst the myriads
of beings who have distinguished themselves herein, the
Fitz-Gwarines deserve an eminent rank, not so much for their
petty and incessant skirmishes with the Welsh, as for the
readiness with which they fought for their king, in divers
engagements and campaigns, greatly to their honour and the glory
of the English arms.</p>
<p>But though war has been the prevailing accomplishment
throughout sacred and prophane history, yet with what ecstasy do
we contemplate that portion of time which providence has allotted
us: free from the intolerable recounters produced by the broils
and dissentions of those turbulent, inflexible, and ambitious
barons, who so disturbed England during the reigns of the Normans
and Plantagenets; and likewise delivered from the well known
calamities of intestine commotions, so productive of civil wars;
the evils of which can be better conceived than described.&nbsp;
On the subject of war I have said more than my limits will allow
to say of any thing else concerning this family; <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>but, who can
help admiring that loftiness of sentiment and nobleness of soul,
which shone in so conspicuous a degree upon the whole race.&nbsp;
Their fidelity to the government, and their readiness to serve
it, are convincing proofs of the advantages England derived from
them, during the long course of time in which they lived;
flourishing with fewer restraints than are commonly attendant on
men in such elevated stations.</p>
<p>That religion was held in great veneration by this race, is
very conspicuous from the number of public and private edifices
built by them, and devoted to pious uses: almost all the churches
and abbies in this neighbourhood were founded by some of the
family, and though the latter are not now in existence, yet the
churches will preserve the memory of their establishers till time
shall be no more.</p>
<p>I have stated that this castle passed into the hands of Henry
VIII.; we hear nothing further concerning it till the following
reign, when the king presented the place in question to Henry
Grey, duke of Suffolk, who forfeited it in consequence of the
conviction of several crimes imputed to him.&nbsp; This took <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>place in the
reign of Mary, and shortly after it was by that queen granted to
Fitz-Alan, last earl of Arundel: he mortgaged it to a number of
London citizens, who obtained the place in default of payment
from him.&nbsp; William Albany chief man among the number was, by
the joint consent and approbation of the rest, put in sole
possession of it.&nbsp; By the marriage of his great grand
daughter with Thomas Lloyd, of Aston, esq. Whittington passed
into the hands of the worthy family who enjoy it at the present
time.</p>
<p>Having given some account of the possessors of Whittington
castle, I think it my duty to attempt laying before the reader, a
short account of this structure, and proceed to shew, that it
must have underwent fortification soon after its original
establishment: placed on the border of Wales, it must have been
alternately in the hands of the Welsh and Saxons; for the latter
of whom it formed a key of great utility in their attacks open
the former, and consequently so useful an inlet, must have been
strongly defended.&nbsp; Indeed its founder could not have chosen
a place in which nature contributed more to its security; finding
the innumerable springs of water so advantageously situated for
his <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>designs, he converted it to the best purpose, and
surrounded the castle with several moats and intrenchments, still
discernable.&nbsp; The annexed plan of the castle <a
name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a> gives the reader a better idea of the
exact situations of the trenches and other out-works, than can be
expressed by words.</p>
<p>The keep was the place of last resort in times of great
danger, and was in consequence defended with the utmost
precaution.&nbsp; In the present case, it was fortified with five
round towers, each forty feet in diameter, an hundred in height,
and the walls twelve in thickness.&nbsp; I have not been able to
discover what time the keep fell into a state of delapidation,
but undoubtedly for a great number of years, as an aged mulbery
is growing in it.</p>
<p>About the year 1760, the eastern tower fell into the moat
after a severe frost, and some years afterwards, one of the
northern towers and the western wall were taken down to repair
the roads leading from Whittington to Halston bridge.&nbsp; The
northern tower that now remains was undermined for the same
purpose.&nbsp; In 1809, a smaller tower, used many years as a
pidgeon house, was taken <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>down to repair the exterior gateway,
which is still inhabited.</p>
<p>The keep is now used as a garden, at an even depth under which
is a pavement of free-stone; at the north corner is a well, which
was discovered and opened in 1809, when there was found the
handle of the bucket, a pair of large iron fetters for the legs,
a large jug, the remains of stags&rsquo; heads and swords; and
upon removing some rubbish about the same time, there appeared a
curious carved stone head, and likewise some highly gilt glass
bottles.</p>
<p>Within the trenches are some very fine tall wych elm and ash
trees, that add greatly to the beauty of the ruins.&nbsp; The
ancient and present state of the castle, is beautifully
contrasted by Mr. Dovaston, in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In ancient days of high renown<br />
Not always did yon castle frown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With ivy-crested brow;<br />
Nor were its&rsquo; walls with moss embrown&rsquo;d,<br />
Nor hung the lanky weeds around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fringe its&rsquo; ruins now.<br />
Other hangings deck&rsquo;d the wall<br />
Where now the nodding foxgloves tall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>Their spotty hoods unfold;<br />
Harebells there with bugloss vie,<br />
And gilliflowers of yellow dye,<br />
Seem now, to musing Fancy&rsquo;s eye,<br />
To mock the mimic tapestry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That flaunted there of old.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is situated amid fine and fertile meadows, through which a
rapid stream having commenced a subterraneous course about a mile
above, here emerging, playfully undulates, having its border
shaded with poplars, till it enters the castle moat, where
encompassing the walls, whose ruins are richly fringed with ivy,
and hung with elegant traces of wild flowers and woodbine, it
enters the Perry amid the meadows below, formerly the site of an
extensive lake.&nbsp; The ancient fosses and intrenchments may
yet very visibly be traced to a surprising distance beyond the
castle, westward, from where the lake terminated, in some fields
still called &ldquo;<i>The Runtings</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The internal scenery, where the aged elms expand their immense
arms among the now gloomy ruins, formerly the place of hilarity
and carousing, is, perhaps, not surpassed by any on the
border.</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>A court
leet and court baron are annually holden by the Lord of the Manor
in a room in the castle, to which the inhabitants are summoned to
pay <i>one penny</i> each, and upon non-attendance are fined
<i>sixpence</i>.&nbsp; Chief-rents are paid to the Lord.</p>
<p>In the township of Daywell in the parish of Whittington,
Watt&rsquo;s Dyke makes its appearance, extending from a place
called Gobowen, adjoining the parish of Selattyn, into that of
St. Martins.&nbsp; The extent between this Dyke and Offa&rsquo;s
(which crosses the hills above Selattyn) is about four
miles.&nbsp; These Dykes point north and south, and the
intervening space is said to have been a common mart, where the
English and Welsh met to carry on a commercial intercourse, with
each other; but, if either party transgressed these bounds, they
were exposed to the severities of war.&nbsp; Upon Watt&rsquo;s
Dyke, at a place called Brynycastle, near to Gobowen, is the site
of an old <i>Watch-fort</i>, and another a little further on
towards St. Martins.</p>
<h2><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span><i>The
Village of Whittington</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village is on the great London
and Holyhead road, and also, on the turnpike road leading from
Oswestry to Ellesmere.&nbsp; It consists of a considerable
collection of houses thinly scattered, a church, a school for
each sex, and the remains of the castle before mentioned.&nbsp;
In ancient records we find it called <i>Chwytunton</i>,
<i>Wititone</i>, <i>Whittentonne</i>, and <i>Vica Alba</i>.&nbsp;
It is situated in latitude 52&deg; 55&prime; 30&Prime; north, and
longitude 2&deg; 57&prime; 30&Prime; west.&nbsp; The church is a
rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s books at &pound;25. 4s.; it
was originally designed, as before stated, as a chapel to the
castle, and was dedicated to St. John the Baptist.&nbsp; The body
of the church was rebuilt in 1806, from a design of Mr. Harrison,
of Chester; it is a large brick building of sixty feet by fifty,
and cost &pound;1500.: to lessen the expense, two briefs were
procured that raised &pound;703. 15s. 1d. but of this sum, only
&pound;42. 2s. 1d. was received for the intended purpose.&nbsp;
It is much to be regretted that this evil is not amended, a
grievance so universally complained of, and <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>so frequently
practised, should not be tolerated by such an enlightened
legislature as that of the English, but still it remains a
nuisance to the very interests of religion itself.&nbsp; In the
body of the church are three aisles and six rows of seats, all
faced with Dantzic oak; the ceiling is neatly executed, being
made of wood, and consequently very pleasant to the officiating
minister.&nbsp; In the gallery stands a barrel organ, placed
there by subscription, in 1810; it was built by <i>England</i>,
and is considered a good instrument.</p>
<p>In 1761, the church-yard contained several venerable yew
trees, which Mr. Roberts, the then rector, had the bad taste to
destroy and replace with lime trees.&nbsp; In the garden at the
Rectory is an uncommonly fine yew tree; it is seventeen and a
half feet in circumference at the distance of four feet from the
ground, about forty feet in height, and the space of ground under
the branches is one hundred and forty-two feet and a half in
circumference: it is very healthy and in a growing state.&nbsp;
Evelyn says, that the reason yew trees were so universally
planted in church-yards was, doubtless, from its being thought a
symbol of immortality, the tree being so lasting and always
green.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>In
1810, the church-yard wall being in bad repair, was rebuilt with
stone, and the gates removed opposite to the entrance to the
steeple.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
